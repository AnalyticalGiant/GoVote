# GoVote
Local voter registration and election candidate application.

*Detailed description of the project comming soon!*

## Installation
Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 4 installed (we strongly recommend using Node >= 6 and npm >= 3).
We prefer to use the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) npm client.

### To install:

````
    cd path-to-my-dev-directory
    git clone https://github.com/codeforgso/GoVote.git && cd goodtogogso && yarn
    yarn start
````

If you prefer to use npm, the equivalent procedure is:

````
    cd path-to-my-dev-directory
    git clone https://github.com/codeforgso/GoVote.git && cd goodtogogso && npm install
    npm start
````

The client application is running at http://localhost:8080/. 

## Basic Architecture

The server side is implemented via Express. The public site is a React/Redux App.
